# APCSA Java
Hi, Im a student in APCSA. We use CodeHS for some of our assignments. I had trouble during some of the year with some of the assignments so I made this github to help others :) <b>
This should only be used as a tool for studying. Remember, if you dont know the content by the end of the course, you wont do well on the AP test. Use this at your own risk.
